Files can be read by simply entering their name into the terminal, including the file extension.

Opening the `boring_shit` directory simply lists out the three files that we can see here already. The files within can be opened the same way as files directly in `/backroom.local`, there is no notion of "working directory". However, trying to open `music`, `old_photos` or `dont_open` results in the error message `File is corrupted`.

Trying to open the `anton_private.enc` using the same syntax as other files results in this being printed in the terminal:
> [QUESTION] File is encrypted. Password required.  
> Usage: anton_private.enc \<password>

The correct command is `anton_private.enc Emilia`
